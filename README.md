Apache Maven is able to generate websites containing information about the project, these are generated by the [maven-site-plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/). The style and design of these sites can be modified through the use of 'skins', the [default skin](https://maven.apache.org/skins/maven-default-skin/) has not been updated since it was created. This project aims to provide a [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) based skin which follows the [design layouts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/) the bootstrap project provides. It allows you to supply a [Bootswatch Theme](https://bootswatch.com/) as a CSS file as well as other additional CSS.

The skin allows a number of configuration options allowing you to alter the layout to suit your design tastes. Example skin configurations have been provided to demonstrate the [default navbar layout](https://stevecrox.github.io/io.github.stevecrox/maven-site-bootstrap-skin-parent/boostrap-skin-navbar) and the [Apache standard layout](https://stevecrox.github.io/io.github.stevecrox/maven-site-bootstrap-skin-parent/boostrap-skin-apache-options).

## Features
The main features offered by the skin are:

* Bootstrap Icons
* Responsive Design
* Theming Support

## Usage
To use this skin in your project, use the skin element of the site.xml site descriptor:
```xml
    <project name="xxx">
      [...]
      <skin>
          <groupId>io.github.stevecrox</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-site-bootstrap-skin-parent</artifactId>
          <version>1.0.0</version>
      </skin>
      [...]
    </project>
```

## Acknowledgement
The original goal was to update the [Maven Fluido Skin](https://maven.apache.org/skins/maven-fluido-skin) to Bootstrap 5. This encountered several issues:
* Migrating from Bootstrap 2.8.2 to Bootstrap 3 required significant modifications
* The project wishes to maintain the default skin layout and Bootstrap classes didn't easily confirm to this
* There were a number of use cases which were important due to the layout choices which made upgrading complex
